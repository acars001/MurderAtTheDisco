	<p class="detective">Detective: Hello. I don't usually start with pleasantries but I couldn't seem to find your name on the system. I am Detective Munroe, and you are?</p>
	<p class="janitor">Janitor: Oh, hello...  (struggling to rememeber)  ...Mr Munroe. My name is Henry, how can I help? <p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: Henry, I understand you were working on the night Maria was murdered. Is this correct?</p>
	<p class="janitor">Henry: Maria? Oh, yes of course that poor girl.</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: Indeed. To confirm you were working that night?</p>
	<p class="janitor">Henry: Let me check my diary. (flicks through a small pocket journal) Ah yes, I was working that night, you are correct.</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: An unnamed source said you called the ambulance and then diappeared, is that correct?</p>
	<p class="janitor">Henry: Oh, that doesn't sound like me. I do tend to be forgetful maybe I lost track of what I was doing?</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: Not to be insensitive but, you forgot someone was dead?</p>
	<p class="janitor">Henry: Oh, um. I am not sure. I have been awfuly ditzy these days.</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: This is a matter of urgency, so please try your best to remember.</p>
	<p class="janitor">Henry: I am terribly sorry, sir. I really want to help. <br> I did call the ambulance, yes, she had fallen.</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: You weren't present at the time of the fall, where you?</p>
	<p class="janitor">Henry: No, no. I mean I am just guessing she fell that's how these things happen. I'm sure this was all an accident</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: Accidents are common, yes. Okay Henry, thank you for your cooperation. You are free to go</p>
	<br>
	<p class="insideThoughts">Detective's Thoughts: Henry seems very forgetful. I wonder if there's something going on? </p>
