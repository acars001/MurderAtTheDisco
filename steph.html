	<p class="detective">Detective: Tell me about how you and Maria knew each other.</p>
	<p class="steph">Steph: Well we were best friends. I've known her since I left school and we became close soon after. We joined the dance team together. </p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: Was there ever any competition between the two of you? When it comes to dancing, I mean.</p>
	<p class="steph">Steph: Well, yes. But I would say it was fairly healthy, we pushed each other to be better. I always strived to become the coach instead of her</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: Interesting. Would you not say that gives you motive to murder her?</p>
	<p class="steph">Steph: No, no, no. It's not like that! I just meant I would have liked to be the best member of the team and lead us to victory. It's always been a dream of mine but I always knew she was better than me</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: Okay, I understand. Everyone wants to be the best at what they do. Myself included.
	For documentations sake, where were you on the night she was killed around 1am? I understand you found her body, yes?</p>
	<p class="steph">Steph: (getting emotional) Ye... Yes. I found her that night.</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: We can take a quick break if you'd like?</p>
	<p class="steph">Steph: No, i'd like to get this over with. I found her that night. I was just walking in to practice around 9, as we had a big competition coming up. I was Maria's understudy so I was working hard to learn both of our parts. When I got into the main hall I found her there, not breathing. I didn't know what to do so I screamed in shock and soon after the janitor came running in. He called the ambulance but I didn't see him afterwards which I thought was a little odd. Perhaps to let me grieve?</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: </p>
	
	<p class="insideThoughts">Detective's Thoughts: It seems oddly convenient that she was there that night especially as she does have a motive? But how badly did she want to be captain? She did seem very shaken up however.</p>
