				<p>Henry was the murderer!</p>
				<br>
				<p>He seemed inconspicuous but that what he wanted us to think</p>
				<p>He played into his age by lying when he started the job and  <br> constantly displaying symptoms of aging and early-onset dementia</p>
				<p>He is actually only in his 60s and is perfectly healthy</p>
				<p>His plan was to rob the place and act innocent. <br> He knew they would find him on the CCTV but had knew about Zach <br> and Maria's secret relationship so would blackmail <br> Zach to delete the footage<p>
				<p>He tried to kill Maria as she found out his <br> real age after he dropped his ID that same night</p>
				<p>He couldn't let her tell anyone so he killed her attempting <br> to make it look like an accident</p>
				<p>He tried to set up Maria's brother by stealing <br> her phone and messaging him to bring her bag to <br> the studio right at the time of her murder</p>
