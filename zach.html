	<p class="detective">Detective: Tell me about how you and Maria knew each other.</p>
	<p class="zach">Zach: I didn't know her that well. I mean we were friends and had gone on a couple nights out but that's about it.</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: So you didn't see each other outside of group activities or when you were bartending at Disco Fever?</p>
	<p class="zach">Zach: (Bluntly) No.</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: Can you tell me where you were on the night she was killed, around 1am?</p>
	<p class="zach">Zach: I was at home. I finished around 12 and left. Didn't fancy sticking around.</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: That's understandable. Just to be clear you didn't see Maria enter the building at any point?</p>
	<p class="zach">Zach: (getting visibly annoyed) No. It's not my job to check every room before I leave.</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: Of course, my apologies. I'm just trying to get more information.</p>
	<p class="zach">Zach: (walking towards the door) Well find it elsewhere.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="insideThoughts">Detective's Thoughts: Well that was strange. I wonder what I did to make him to annoyed? He doesn't seem to be guilty but he is definitely hiding something. I wonder what it could be? </p>
