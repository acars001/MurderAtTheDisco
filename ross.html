	<p class="detective">Detective: Hello, Ross. I have reason to believe you were present the night of Maria's murder. Is this correct?</p>
	<p class="ross">Ross: I was at the studio earlier I was just dropping off maria's bag.</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: I'm afraid we have evidence against that statement. This means you are now a suspect in the murder of Maria.</p>
	<p class="ross">Ross: Oh, okay.</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: Can you tell me why you were at the studio that night.</p>
	<p class="ross">Ross: I was just meeting up with Zach. He can explain why.</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: That's strange cause Zach said you had just ran into each other. Please refrain from lying, it will only make you look worse.</p>
	<p class="ross">Ross: Okay. I just bumped into Zach. I was actually looking for Steph.</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: Why did you not mention this earlier?</p>
	<p class="ross">Ross: I suppose it's because I thought I'd look guilty. I was planning on finally asking her out so went looking for her at the studio but then I... I heard shouting. I tried to find out where it was coming from but by the time I had found the source my sister was already dead. I didn't know what to do, so I left. I bumped into Zach on the way out and I told him to delete the footage, I had hoped it would erase any evidence of me being at the studio. I swear I didn't do anything. Oh, and I didn't see anything either.</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: Did you not think to go and save your sister? Or even comfort Steph?</p>
	<p class="ross">Ross: Honestly, I wanted to but I panicked and fled. You have to believe me!</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: Alright (quickly scribbling something down into his journal). Thank you for your cooperation. You may go.</p>
	<p class="ross">Ross: Are you sure? Do you believe me?</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: I am sure. Please leave whenever you are ready.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="insideThoughts">Detective's Thoughts: His sister has died so I understand he's not going to be in a right frame of mind but running away from the crime scene is very suspicious. He seems to care for Stephanie but why not run to her when her best friend has died? Also he really wanted me to believe his story so I don't know how much I can trust his statement.</p>
