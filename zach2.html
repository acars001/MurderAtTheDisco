	<p class="detective">Detective: Hello, Zach. I don't know if you had heard but we finally managed to uncover the missing CCTV footage. It seems to have been deleted by someone from the server and we know you were the only one with access at that time. Any comments?</p>
	<p class="zach">Zach: Oh sh*t.</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: I thought you may react like that.</p>
	<p class="zach">Zach: I, well... You don't understand!</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: Help me to understand then, Zach. I know you are hiding something but it doesn't mean I think you are guilty.</p>
	<p class="zach">Zach: I really didn't want to delete the footage but I made a promise. A promise I intended to keep, but I suppose it doesn't matter now. Me and Maria were dating in secret. Both of our parents are super strict so we knew nobody could ever find out or we would never see each other again. But I never intended to delete the footage, you can ask... oh, nevermind.</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: I can see how that must have been hard. Was there soemone with you when you deleted the footage?</p>
	<p class="zach">Zach: (getting visibly upset) Ye... yes, its been awful. We had almost saved up enough money. We were going to go away for a bit just so we could be together properly, with no sneaking around. I didn't ever imagine something like this would happen. And yes there was someone with me but I dont want him, I mean them, to get into trouble.</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: He won't get into trouble, I promise. I simply need to know all the details so I can solve the murder.</p>
	<p class="zach">Zach: Okay I suppose it's for the best but you didn't hear from me. Ross (Maria's younger brother) was with me. I bumped into him and was panicking so I asked him for advice. He said I should keep my promise to honour her, so I did.</p>
	<p class="detective">Detective: Alright thank you for letting me know. I can assure you all information shared is confidential. You are free to go.</p>
	<p class="zach">Zach: Thank you, Detective.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="insideThoughts">Detective's Thoughts:  His reasoning makes sense but I just don't know if he is telling the truth. Why would he delete the footage and risk being taken to prison? I suppose he is grieving. And what was ross doing that night? Did he see anything or perhaps kill Maria?</p>
