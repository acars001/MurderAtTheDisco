		<p>We did some digging into Ross and it turns out there was a restraining order filed against him but it wasn't fully processed so we didn't find it the first time.</p>
		<p>The interesting thing is it was filed by Steph. This means his story of wanting to ask her on a date doesn't seem likely.</p>
		<p>Was he there to stalk her? Or perhaps to kill Maria?</p>
		<p>If he is a potential stalker who knows where he would draw the line to see her.</p>
		<p>We intervieved Steph about the situation and she shut it down saying she didn't want to incriminate her best friends brother. She respected her too much, she instead made a deal that Ross would stay away from her.</p>
		<p>So, him being at the studio at the same time as her is looking slightly suspicious</p>
		<br>
		<p>The autopsy report has also came back and it turns out there are signs of struggle before deaf and it seems she died from blunt force trauma. Almost as though it was made to look like it was an accident</p>
