		<p>The manager finally managed to get a hold of the missing CCTV. Tapes from the whole day had been erased and it doesn't seem like an accident either. The code to delete tapes is highly protected and only two people have access. The manager who has already provided a clear alibi... and Zach, the bar manager. So, why did he delete the tapes and what is he hidding? </p>
		<p>Transcript from the CCTV footage from 12:35:09</p>
		<p>Voice 1: Shhh. Someone might hear us!</p>
		<p>Voice 2: Don't worry. I triple checked no one is here. Just the cleaner and he won't remember anyways. He's got dementia.</p>
		<p>Voice 1: Ah, of course. I still don't think we should keep this up. Someone is bound to find out. </p>
		<p>Voice 2: I know. It's just easier for me cause I can say I had to work late. Plus I have access to the security tapes if anything goes wrong</p>
		<p>Voice 1: If you say so. </p>

		<p class="insideThoughts">Detective's Thoughts: That second voice sounds very familiar. Almost identical to Zach's now that I think about it! </p>
